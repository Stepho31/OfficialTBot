Liquidity sweep During Friday\u2019s impulsive rally, EURUSD swept liquidity above the recent highs and simultaneously filled all the bearish fair value gaps. This move, while initially strong, did not manage to establish a sustainable break above those highs. As a result, bearish momentum began to reappear, suggesting that the rally was more of a liquidity grab rather than the start of a prolonged bullish trend. Bullish case scenario The bullish scenario from here would require EURUSD to reclaim strength and invalidate the recently formed bearish 4-hour FVG. For this to happen, the pair would need a decisive 4-hour candle close above this zone, signaling renewed upside momentum. Should buyers manage to achieve this, the next logical target would be another attempt at the highs that were swept on Friday. A confirmed break above those levels would strengthen the bullish case and potentially open the path to higher price levels. Bearish case scenario On the other hand, the bearish scenario appears more probable if EURUSD faces rejection at the bearish 4-hour FVG. A failure to break above this area would confirm that the bearish momentum is still in play. If that occurs, price will likely seek liquidity by moving lower, potentially targeting the bullish 4-hour FVG that sits beneath the liquidity zone. This move would align with the broader bearish structure and reinforce the idea that the market remains under selling pressure despite Friday\u2019s rally. Final thoughts In conclusion, EURUSD is currently at a critical juncture, with both bullish and bearish scenarios still on the table. The decisive factor will be how price reacts around the bearish 4-hour FVG. A strong close above could set the stage for a continuation to the upside, while rejection from this zone would likely lead to a liquidity grab to the downside and a revisit of lower fair value gaps. Traders should remain cautious and patient, waiting for clear confirmations before committing to a direction, as the market continues to balance between bullish hopes and bearish pressure. ------------------------- Disclosure: I am part of Trade Nation's Influencer program and receive a monthly fee for using their TradingView charts in my analysis.

EUR/USD experienced notable volatility, driven mainly by key economic data from both the Eurozone and the U.S. In the Eurozone, the service PMI showed a slight recovery, but it still fell short of expectations, raising doubts about the sustainability of economic growth in this sector. In contrast, U.S. labor market data showed a slower pace of new job creation, but still exceeded forecasts. This increased the likelihood of the Federal Reserve maintaining a more aggressive stance on interest rates. These factors led to sharp movements in EUR/USD, with continuous ups and downs. Currently, the pair is trading around 1.164, moving below the trendline and showing some consolidation near the EMA 34.

After the liquidity sweep to the downside, price reacted strongly by moving upwards, indicating a shift in market structure. The pair has since inverted the previously bearish 4-hour fair value gap, which now acts as a bullish reference point, and is currently holding within the 1-hour fair value gap. As long as price maintains this 1-hour FVG support, there remains a strong case for further upside movement. Liquidity Sweep The recent downside liquidity sweep was a significant turning point. By driving below key lows and collecting stop orders, EURUSD effectively cleared the market of weak positions. This was followed by a sharp rejection, represented by a wick, which signaled strong buying interest at these levels. Since then, the market has been climbing steadily, showing intent to challenge the higher liquidity levels resting above. Inversion Following the liquidity sweep, EURUSD inverted the bearish 4-hour fair value gap. What was previously an area of supply and resistance has now been reclaimed and transformed into a demand zone. This inversion is an important bullish signal because it indicates that sellers were absorbed and that buyers have successfully taken control. As long as this zone remains intact, the path of least resistance continues to lean upward. 1-Hour Bullish FVG Currently, EURUSD is resting on a 1-hour bullish fair value gap. This area serves as an important support level, and as long as it holds, price is likely to use it as a springboard for further gains. The next targets lie at the upside, beginning with the first objective at the intermediate resistance level labeled \u201cTarget 1,\u201d before ultimately pushing towards the liquidity area above. By reaching this zone, the market would sweep short-side liquidations and potentially trigger momentum-driven buying. Target Area The primary targets for this bullish move are the two significant highs above the current range. These highs represent zones where stop-loss orders are most likely accumulated. By driving into and above these levels, EURUSD will effectively complete a liquidity grab, providing bulls with a logical profit-taking zone before the market considers a possible retracement. Such a move would align with the general principle of markets seeking liquidity before establishing a new direction. Final Thoughts In summary, EURUSD is showing constructive price action following its downside liquidity sweep and subsequent bullish reversal. The inversion of the 4-hour FVG and the current defense of the 1-hour FVG are both encouraging signs for buyers. As long as the 1-hour fair value gap continues to act as a firm support, the probability of an upward continuation towards the liquidity area remains strong. However, traders should also remain mindful that once the liquidity above the highs is collected, a corrective move to the downside could develop.

After the liquidity sweep to the downside, price reacted strongly by moving upwards, indicating a shift in market structure. The pair has since inverted the previously bearish 4-hour fair value gap, which now acts as a bullish reference point, and is currently holding within the 1-hour fair value gap. As long as price maintains this 1-hour FVG support, there remains a strong case for further upside movement. Liquidity Sweep The recent downside liquidity sweep was a significant turning point. By driving below key lows and collecting stop orders, EURUSD effectively cleared the market of weak positions. This was followed by a sharp rejection, represented by a wick, which signaled strong buying interest at these levels. Since then, the market has been climbing steadily, showing intent to challenge the higher liquidity levels resting above. Inversion Following the liquidity sweep, EURUSD inverted the bearish 4-hour fair value gap. What was previously an area of supply and resistance has now been reclaimed and transformed into a demand zone. This inversion is an important bullish signal because it indicates that sellers were absorbed and that buyers have successfully taken control. As long as this zone remains intact, the path of least resistance continues to lean upward. 1-Hour Bullish FVG Currently, EURUSD is resting on a 1-hour bullish fair value gap. This area serves as an important support level, and as long as it holds, price is likely to use it as a springboard for further gains. The next targets lie at the upside, beginning with the first objective at the intermediate resistance level labeled \u201cTarget 1,\u201d before ultimately pushing towards the liquidity area above. By reaching this zone, the market would sweep short-side liquidations and potentially trigger momentum-driven buying. Target Area The primary targets for this bullish move are the two significant highs above the current range. These highs represent zones where stop-loss orders are most likely accumulated. By driving into and above these levels, EURUSD will effectively complete a liquidity grab, providing bulls with a logical profit-taking zone before the market considers a possible retracement. Such a move would align with the general principle of markets seeking liquidity before establishing a new direction. Final Thoughts In summary, EURUSD is showing constructive price action following its downside liquidity sweep and subsequent bullish reversal. The inversion of the 4-hour FVG and the current defense of the 1-hour FVG are both encouraging signs for buyers. As long as the 1-hour fair value gap continues to act as a firm support, the probability of an upward continuation towards the liquidity area remains strong. However, traders should also remain mindful that once the liquidity above the highs is collected, a corrective move to the downside could develop. For now, the short-term bias stays bullish, with clearly defined targets on the upside. ------------------------- Disclosure: I am part of Trade Nation's Influencer program and receive a monthly fee for using their TradingView charts in my analysis.

On the European side, sticky inflation has reduced immediate expectations of monetary easing from the ECB.

The price auction for EURUSD has been operating within a well-defined ascending channel for several weeks. This bullish structure has been confirmed by multiple pivot points, with buyers defending the ascending demand line and sellers consistently emerging at the upper supply zone near the 1.1715 level. This has established a clear rotational pattern between the channel's boundaries. Currently, the auction is at a critical inflection point, once again testing the upper boundary of this channel. The price has rallied to meet the ascending supply line, which forms a strong confluence of resistance with the horizontal 1.1715 - 1.1740 supply area. This is the same zone where previous rallies have failed, making it a key battleground. The primary scenario anticipates a rejection from this resistance confluence, continuing the established pattern of rotation. The expectation is that sellers will defend the supply zone and initiate a new downward move back towards the channel's support. A failure to break out higher would confirm a short-term correction is underway. The take-profit for this rotational play is therefore set at 1.1605 points, targeting the ascending demand line of the channel.
